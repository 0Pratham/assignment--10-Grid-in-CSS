Q -> Explain the difference between justify-items and justify-self using code examples.
Ans ->  
        JUSTIFY-ITEMS
        Justify The justify-items property is set on the grid container to give child elements (grid items) alignment
	 in the inline direction. inline direction is left to right( or Horizontal) and block direction is downward(or Vertical).
	 Using this , we shift items(or child) according to need . Some of values of attribute are -> start , end , space-between , etc.
		Code ->  
	style.css 
	      .container{
			display : grid;
			justify-content: space-between;
		}
	index.html
		<body>
			<div class="container";>
				<div class="box boxA">A</div>
				<div class="box boxB">B</div>
		--> now in this there will be an space between 'A' and 'B' just like 'A' will get shift to left direction and 'B' will get
			 shift towards right direction.

	JUSTIFY-SELF
	Justify The justify-self property is set on the particular child or at main container to give alignment to itself .
	 in the inline direction . Using this , we shift items(or child) according to need . Some of values of attribute are -> start , end , stretch, etc.
		Code ->  
	style.css 
	      .container{
			display : grid;
			height: 300px;
           		width: 400px;
		}
	      .boxA{
		    justify-self : right;
			}
	index.html
		<body>
			<div class="container";>
				<div class="box boxA">A</div>
				<div class="box boxB">B</div>
		--> now in this boxA will be shifted in right side of boundary of main container .
